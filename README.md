# My Portfolio

This projects the best projects I have created *so far*.

If you are interested in my projects, you can visit the running [website](https://topuportfolio.onrender.com/).

My github account is also a portfolio, but this website is a bit more pleasing for users, while also highlighting my skills as a developer.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nikatopu/topuportfolio.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd topuportfolio
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

Start the server

```bash
  nodemon index.js
```

Open the server on your localhost with the port `3000`
