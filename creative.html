          &ensp;Only the poem part of this animation was done by me. Animation
          was done by my sister - <b>Mariam Topuridze</b>, and the music by my
          brother - <b>Ioane Topuridze</b>.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The idea of the poem came to me from watching a simple video
          describing the differences between two types of caterpillars, who
          basically live the same lives but can turn into different types of
          creatures after development.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;Working on this poem was quite interesting. The writing was,
          well, usual to say the least. What made it interesting was working
          with my siblins afterwards to create something of ours. Later on I was
          even tasked to translate it to ENGLISH, which, I think, I did quite
          well.

      <h2>Bruises of a White Dove</h2>

          &ensp;This is one of the poems which I greatly admire. I do admit that
          at some points I believe I could have done better, written better, but
          I still love it.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The way I got the idea to write this poem was an outcome of two
          different situations. Firstly, I was writing a large poem, one
          containing lots of chapters, when I came across a scene of an opera
          song, so I needed to make something emotional, something that would
          get into people's hearts. Secondly, I was recently going through
          media, watching all of the wild animalistic things unhold in the
          world, when I came to a realization, that I was chained to it, chained
          to the ground and the people that were free - were hated.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;This poem is a great one, because it is a product of two
          personal problems crashing into eachother. I am glad that I was able
          to work in a problematic situation and come up with a creative poem
          that resolved the given problems.
