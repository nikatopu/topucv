      <h1>SHORT POEMS</h1>
      <h2>So, Let's Fly Far...</h2>
      <div class="photo-text">
        <video width="250px" height="auto" controls>
          <source src="fly far.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
        <p>
          &ensp;Only the poem part of this animation was done by me. Animation
          was done by my sister - <b>Mariam Topuridze</b>, and the music by my
          brother - <b>Ioane Topuridze</b>.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The idea of the poem came to me from watching a simple video
          describing the differences between two types of caterpillars, who
          basically live the same lives but can turn into different types of
          creatures after development.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;Working on this poem was quite interesting. The writing was,
          well, usual to say the least. What made it interesting was working
          with my siblins afterwards to create something of ours. Later on I was
          even tasked to translate it to ENGLISH, which, I think, I did quite
          well.

      <h2>Bruises of a White Dove</h2>
      <div class="photo-text">
        <img src="white dove.jpg" />
        <p>
          &ensp;This is one of the poems which I greatly admire. I do admit that
          at some points I believe I could have done better, written better, but
          I still love it.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The way I got the idea to write this poem was an outcome of two
          different situations. Firstly, I was writing a large poem, one
          containing lots of chapters, when I came across a scene of an opera
          song, so I needed to make something emotional, something that would
          get into people's hearts. Secondly, I was recently going through
          media, watching all of the wild animalistic things unhold in the
          world, when I came to a realization, that I was chained to it, chained
          to the ground and the people that were free - were hated.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;This poem is a great one, because it is a product of two
          personal problems crashing into eachother. I am glad that I was able
          to work in a problematic situation and come up with a creative poem
          that resolved the given problems.
          <br />

      <h1>SHORT NOVELS</h1>
      <h2>Where Angels Cry</h2>
      <div class="photo-text">
        <img src="angels cry.jpg" />
        <p>
          &ensp;God, this brings back memories... It's very old, you know...
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The thing I love the most about this short novel isn't only that
          it clearly shows my true deep emotions, I also admire it because of
          how well-written it is for someone at the age of 16...
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;This short written collage of emotions tells a story about a
          great mistake, a lost dream that I regret ever letting go. The mix of
          regret, pain & suffery creates a weirdly familiar face...
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;I learned a lot from writing this and it was the first time I
          understood the value of giving all in a novel, or just any art at all,
          because the deep emotions is what gives art meaning.

      <h2>The Stars Smile Back</h2>
      <div class="photo-text">
        <img src="stars smile back.jpg" />
        <p>
          &ensp;This short novel is trully one of my favorites. Even with some
          doubts in the writing, I still admire it.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The short monologue contains the feeling of dealing with
          loneliness. How one may look for the answer in the nature and how hope
          trully motivates a person to look beyond the horizon.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;The stars smile back isn't only a monologue of a single
          "depressed" person, but it is the true image of a lonely human
          desperate to seek validation not from the people, not from family but
          from the nature, from the world itself.
          <br />
          <br />
          &ensp;When people hurt us, disappoint us, we do not look for salvation
          in humanity but rather in the deep mysteries of the mythical world we
          call home.
