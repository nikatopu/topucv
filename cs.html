              &ensp; This is the game I am most proud of. I do, however,
              criticize the mixed genre of puzzle and "action".
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>&ensp; CUBICAL</b> was created for fun using a 2D Game Engine -
              GameMaker. The whole idea was to create a 3D looking game using a
              2D Game Engine.
              <br />
              <br />
              &ensp; By working on this project I have learned the aspects of
              creating interesting puzzles along with creating 2D art & sound
              effects. I gained a lot of experience and a lot of insight in the
              world of Game Development, as well as in the industry of
              programming as a whole.

            <p>
              &ensp; This is the game I am mostly proud of. The minuses with
              this game is - <b>TOO MUCH DIALOGUE!</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>&ensp; THE ROBODVENTURE</b> was created for A CHRISTMAS GAMEJAM
              in a 2D Game Engine - GameMaker. The idea of the GameJam was to be
              a "GameDev Santa" for a chosen individual. They sent me a letter
              of what kind of games they liked and I had to come up with the
              game concept & create it.
              <br />
              <br />
              &ensp; By working on this project I explored new possibilities in
              the game development field, while also working in a limited time
              period (1 Month).

            <p>
              &ensp; This game, I'm not that proud of... But I do admit, it is
              good for how it was made...
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>&ensp; QUIT HORSING AROUND! </b> was also created for a GameJam
              in a 2D Game Engine - GameMaker. Through limitations and the
              theme, I came up with a decently smart idea to turn the phrase
              "Quit Horsing Around" into the main punchline of this fast
              action-based game.
              <br />
              <br />
              &ensp; By working on this project I learned working under
              stressful situations and in a tight timeline, thus developing
              great skills.
